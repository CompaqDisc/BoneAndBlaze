# Bone'n'Blaze
Bone'n'Blaze is a mod that I wrote myself, it adds a subset of blaze tools and armor.

To modify:

1. Clone the source to your local machine.
2. Download the forge source files (I used forge-1.8-11.14.3.1450-src).
3. Have eclipse downloaded and installed on your local machine.
4. Extract the forge source zip to a workspace of your choice.
5. In your terminal program run "./gradlew setupDecompWorkspace eclipse".
6. Copy the src folder of the Bone'n'Blaze source into the forge source folder, it should merge with the existing folder and / or replace a file.
7. Begin development as normal, Using the subdirectory "eclipse" as your workspace.
